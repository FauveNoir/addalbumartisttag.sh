SH script to copy artist tag to empty album_artist tag in music file format

Some music files havent the `ALBUMARTIST` tag set. So, in iTunes-like players when the left column is sorted by `ALBUMARTIST` many track are sorted in the `<empty>` section for unknown `ALBUMARTIST`. This is mainly usefull for collection with various artist albums, like OST albums.
